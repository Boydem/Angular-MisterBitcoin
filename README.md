# Welcome to the Angular App:
Bitcoin Wallet repository! This project is part of an Angular workshop at CodingAcademy. This application is a simple Bitcoin wallet that allows users to sign up, view their balance and transaction history, and manage their contacts.

## Pages
The application has two main pages:

## Home page:
Users must first sign up to access this page. Once logged in, users can view their current Bitcoin balance, market prices charts, and transaction history.
Contacts page: Users can view, add, edit, and remove their contacts. They can also transfer Bitcoin to their contacts.
Technologies Used
This project is built using Angular and the Chart.js library. Full CRUD functionality is implemented in the contacts page.

## Developing with Angular
I liked working with Angular in this project because:

- Angular provides a more structured approach to developing applications with its use of modules
- Angular's dependency injection system makes it easy to develop and test applications
- Angular's two-way data binding and change detection system provides a fast and responsive user interface.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run ng serve to start the application. You can then navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the application.
