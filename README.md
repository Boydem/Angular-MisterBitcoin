## Pages
The application has two main pages:

### Home page
Users must first sign up to access this page. Once logged in, users can view their current Bitcoin balance, market prices charts, and transaction history.

### Contacts page
Users can view, add, edit, and remove their contacts. They can also transfer Bitcoin to their contacts.

## Technologies Used
This project is built using Angular and the Chart.js library. Full CRUD functionality is implemented in the contacts page.

## Developing with Angular
I liked working with Angular in this project because:

- Angular provides a more structured approach to developing applications with its use of modules
- Angular's dependency injection system makes it easy to develop and test applications
- Angular's two-way data binding and change detection system provides a fast and responsive user interface.
